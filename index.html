					Dieter Günther Bohlen (7 February 1954, Berne, Lower Saxony, near Oldenburg) is a German songwriter, singer, musician, producer, entertainer, and TV personality. Bohlen is best known for being part of popular pop-duo Modern Talking during 1983–1987 and 1998–2003.
				</p>

				<p>
					Bohlen took his Abitur in Oldenburg. His father was a supplier to the construction business. In 1978, Dieter Bohlen was member of the band Monza. In 1981 he was member of trio Sunday, and they had a hit "Hale Hey Louise", which has been covered by Ricky King and others. From 1983 to 1987 and from 1998 to 2003, Bohlen was one half of the pop duo Modern Talking as producer, songwriter and composer. From 1985 to 1988, he produced and wrote songs for the disco singer C. C. Catch.

					In 1988, Dieter Bohlen signed 15-year-old singer Anna Garcia whose stage name was "Sheree".[3] In 1988 she recorded a song "Ronnie – Talk To Russia!" as Sheree,[2] written by German songwriter and former member of Modern Talking, Dieter Bohlen.

					After Modern Talking's first split in 1987, Bohlen formed Blue System. For most projects Bohlen had session singers for the background vocals to produce a high-pitched chorus. He frequently worked in the studio with the producer Luis Rodríguez. Rivalen Der Rennbahn is a soundtrack written by Bohlen. It was one of the best-selling albums in 1989 in Germany.[citation needed] Bohlen produced the German boygroup Touché which was founded by one of the group's five members, Karim Maataoui. In 1986, Bohlen wrote and produced Chris Norman's "Midnight Lady" for an episode of the German crime show Tatort. This song became a major hit in central Europe.

					In the 1990s, Bohlen became producer for Bonnie Tyler under Hansa Records. They released three albums; Bitterblue, Angel Heart and Silhouette in Red. Tyler had great success with her single "Bitterblue", which was written and produced by Bohlen.

					He has been a judge on all the seasons of the talent show Deutschland sucht den Superstar and has worked with acts discovered in the show, yielding several major hits. He is criticized for controversial and insulting comments ("You sing like a garden gnome on ecstasy", "Your voice sounds like Kermit getting his ass kicked"). Bohlen has also released five books. Two of these are autobiographical and describe his career, romantic involvements and experiences with singers. The first book was an unprecedented success in Germany. Both books were also released as audio books.

					In 2006, Bohlen released an album called Dieter: Der Film that was a soundtrack to the movie of the same name.

					In 2011, he founded the clothing label "Needs Clothing" along with Felix Werner.

					He has also been a judge the talent show Das Supertalent, the German version of Britain's Got Talent. He is the only judge to have been in every season of the show.

					Wendelin Wiedeking (born August 28, 1952) is the former President and Chief Executive Officer of the German car manufacturer, Porsche AG, a post he held from 1993 through July 23, 2009. He was also speaker of the company's executive committee and was a member of the supervisory board of Volkswagen AG. He had his first child, Isabel Wiedeking, in 1983 and then his son, Wendelin Wiedeking Junior. He is currently living near Stuttgart.
				</p>

				<p>
					His professional career began in 1983 as Director's Assistant in the Production and Materials Management area of Porsche AG in Stuttgart-Zuffenhausen.[2]

					A mechanical engineer by training, he joined Porsche in 1983, aged 31. After a stint at Wiesbaden based Glyco AG,[3] a subsidiary of auto-parts maker Federal-Mogul, he returned to Porsche as head of production in 1991,[3] taking over two years later as Chairman (CEO) when Porsche was close to bankruptcy. On account of Porsche's large shareholding in Volkswagen, Wiedeking also found himself on the supervisory board of that company. Some industry analysts believed that Porsche could not survive on its own, but Wiedeking, who says he made his first million by the age of 30 with real estate investments, took on the challenge.[4]

					Wiedeking, then 40 years old, who with his spectacles and moustache looked like "a clerk at a venetian blinds manufacturer", according to Der Spiegel magazine, soon imposed his gung-ho management style on the workforce. Within two years he managed a surprise turnaround by trimming the product line-up, modernizing the production system based on Toyota's lean manufacturing system, and negotiating new work rules with the unions.

					Wiedeking asserted in a 2006 interview that "every product must earn money. Otherwise you are simply pursuing a hobby which is no task for an auto-business".[3] By then he had dropped the unprofitable 928 and 968 models, overhauled the iconic 911 and developed two new models, the Boxster convertible and the Cayenne SUV.

					Wiedeking played a leading role in Porsche's attempted takeover of Volkswagen, which was ultimately unsuccessful although windfall gains from financial instruments linked to VW shares helped Wiedeking become the best paid executive in Germany in 2008. The bid left the Porsche holding company with debts of €10 billion, whilst Wiedeking walked away with a severance package of €50million.[5] After his departure from Porsche Wiedeking was charged with market manipulation for his role in the takeover bid.

					Soichiro Honda (本田 宗一郎 Honda Sōichirō?, November 17, 1906 – August 5, 1991) was a Japanese engineer and industrialist.[1] In 1948, he established Honda and oversaw its expansion from a wooden shack manufacturing bicycle motors to a multinational automobile and motorcycle manufacturer.[2]
				</p>

				<p>
					Honda was born in Tenryū, Shizuoka, a small village under Mount Fuji near Hamamatsu on November 17, 1906. He spent his early childhood helping his father, Gihei, a blacksmith, with his bicycle repair business. At the time his mother, Mika, was a weaver. Honda was not interested in traditional education. His school handed grade reports to the children, but required that they be returned stamped with the family seal, to make sure that a parent had seen it. Soichiro created a stamp to forge his family seal out of a used rubber bicycle pedal cover. The fraud was soon discovered when Honda started to make forged stamps for other children. Honda was unaware that the stamp was supposed to be mirror-imaged. His family name 本田 was symmetrical when written vertically, so it did not cause a problem, but some of other children's family names were not.[3]

					Even as a toddler, Honda had been thrilled by the first car that was ever seen in his village, and often used to say in later life that he could never forget the smell of oil it gave off. [4] Soichiro once borrowed one of his father's bicycles to see a demonstration of an airplane made by pilot Art Smith, which cemented his love for machinery and invention.[5]

					At 15, without any formal education, Honda left home and headed to Tokyo to look for work. He obtained an apprenticeship at a garage in 1922, and after some hesitation over his employment, he stayed for six years, working as a car mechanic before returning home to start his own auto repair business in 1928 at the age of 22.[6]

					Honda raced a turbocharged Ford in the "1st Japan Automobile Race" at Tamagawa Speedway in 1936. He crashed and seriously injured his left eye. His brother was also injured. After that, he quit racing.

			<div class="biography">
				<p>
					Kazuo Inamori (稲盛 和夫 Inamori Kazuo?, born January 30, 1932) is a Japanese philanthropist, entrepreneur and the founder of Kyocera Corporation and KDDI Corporation. He is the chairman of Japan Airlines. In 2011, he received the Othmer Gold Medal for outstanding contributions to progress in science and chemistry.[1][2]
				</p>

				<p>
					Kazuo Inamori was born January 21 1932 in Kagoshima, on the island of Kyushu in Japan.[3] Inamori graduated from Kagoshima University in 1955 with a Bachelor of Science degree in applied chemistry.[1] He became a researcher at Shofu Industries in Kyoto, Japan.[3] There he was important in several developments, developing fosterite as an insulator for high frequency radio waves; using fosterite for the mass production of high frequency insulator components; and developing an electric tunnel kiln for use in sintering.[3]

					In 1959, Inamori and several other colleagues established Kyoto Ceramic, later known as Kyocera. The company manufactured high-frequency insulator components for television picture tubes for Matsushita Electronics Industries (later Panasonic) in Japan, and silicon transistor headers for Fairchild Semiconductor and ceramic substrates for IBM in the United States.[3] At Kyocera, Inamori implemented his Amoeba Management system.[4]

					After deregulation of Japan’s telecommunications industry in 1984, Inamori founded Daini Denden (DDI) Corporation. DDI later entered the cell phone business, merging with KDD (Kokusai Denshin Denwa) and IDO (Nippn Idou Tsushin Corporation in 2000 to form KDDI, which has grown to become Japan's second-largest telecommunication services provider.[3]

					At the age of 77, Inamori became the CEO of Japan Airlines when it entered bankruptcy protection on January 19, 2010, and led the air carrier through its restructuring, eventually allowing the company to re-list on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in November 2012.[5] Inamori has been an International Advisor of Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.[6]
